    <section id="about">

        <p class="mainP">You are invited to join us for the third edition of the 
            Blended Intensive Program (BIP 3.0) on <a href="https://www.nord.no/en/about/study-locations/levanger">XR Game Creation at Nord University, Campus Levanger</a>. BIP 3.0 offers an in-depth focus on developing extended reality (XR) gaming experiences, expanding your expertise in game creation processes, remote collaboration, and XR technologies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this course, students will learn the main technologies that support the development of digital games and virtual reality experiences. Students will learn basic aspects of game design, will be introduced to unity as the game engine, and will get to know the characteristics, concepts, and potential and possible drawbacks of virtual reality. </p><br><p>Team management and teamwork methodologies will also be important topics and students will learn how to use them within the given game development setting. Different techniques for developing game ideas, and the use of agile development methods and prototyping techniques to implement them will also be part of this course. Serious games as a practical example for a game development area and how they are used in different domains with a special focus on the healthcare sector will also be focused. </p><br><p>Students will be introduced to serious games, and methods for the design of a game with a specific purpose and will understand how to measure player inputs gathered from sensors and evaluate these outcomes. All those aspects will be used by students to design and implement a chosen game within a selected team group work (4-5 people per group).</p>

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">10 March - 21 March (remote weeks)</li>
            <li class="bold">24 March - 28 March (onsite week)</li>
            <li class="bold">31 March - 16 March (remote week)</li>
        </ul>

      
        <p>The BIP 3.0 is a 3 ECTS course delivered over six weeks, blending online and onsite learning experiences. It follows a 2>1>3 format, consisting of two weeks of online instruction (Phase 1), one week of onsite intensive group work (Phase 2), and three weeks of remote collaborative work (Phase 3).</p>
        <p>During the six weeks, participants will create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an XR Game, which can be used as a portfolio piece in a future CV, or even as a foundation for a future game product that, with some luck, might become a full-fledged commercial XR game.</p>
        
        <h4>Phase 1: Online Instruction</h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>10 March – 21 March</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The course begins with two weeks of online learning, where students will engage with foundational content and prepare for the onsite phase.</p>
        
        <h4>Phase 2: Onsite Intensive Group Work</h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>24 March – 28 March</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The onsite week in Levanger will offer immersive, hands-on experiences featuring interactive group work, guest lectures, workshops, and excursions. This phase deepens students' knowledge through direct collaboration and experiential learning.</p>
        
        <h4>Phase 3: Online Collaborative Work</h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>31 March – 16 April</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The final three weeks will involve remote group work and peer collaboration. Participants will refine their MVP, receive researcher-led guidance, and provide peer-to-peer feedback. This phase concludes with a presentation of their XR game.</p>
    
        <p>More detailed information is available in the complete programme.</p>
